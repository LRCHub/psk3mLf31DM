Greetings loved ones
Lets take a journey
I know a place where
the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something
in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath
the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a
little sneak peek (at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine fresh fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent,
now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand
in our Stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy dog
on the stereo oh oh
You could travel the world
(you could travel the world)
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
(once you party with us)
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine fresh fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Toned tan fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause
it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls
I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
kiss her, touch her,
squeeze her buns (uh)
The girl's a freak
she drive a Jeep
and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bait
just like I love LA
Venice Beach
and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys hangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis
no weenies
just the king and the queenie
Katy my lady (yeah)
Lookie here, baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you're
representin' California
(Ohhhhhh yeah)
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top (hey)
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine fresh fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(California California girls)
(California California girls)
